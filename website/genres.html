                <p1>Role-playing games (RPGs) are a genre of video games where players take on the roles of fictional
                     characters and embark on adventures within immersive worlds. These games often feature complex 
                     storylines, character development, and decision-making, allowing players to shape the narrative 
                     through their choices. RPGs can be single-player experiences, like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, 
                     or multiplayer games, such as World of Warcraft. The genre emphasizes exploration, combat, and 
                     quest-solving, with players typically leveling up their characters and acquiring new abilities or 
                     equipment as they progress. RPGs have become one of the most beloved and influential genres in gaming.

                <h2>FPS Games</h2>
                <p1>First-person shooter (FPS) games are a genre where players experience gameplay from the perspective
                     of the protagonist, typically aiming and shooting with firearms or other weapons. FPS games focus on
                      fast-paced action, reflexes, and strategic combat, often involving team-based objectives or solo missions.
                       Popular titles like Doom, Call of Duty, and Halo have become icons of the genre, offering both single-player 
                       campaigns and multiplayer modes. FPS games emphasize precision, fast reflexes, and coordination, making them
                        a staple in competitive gaming and esports. Over time, they've become a central part of gaming culture, 
                        influencing both game design and the wider media landscape</p1>
